## Create: Enchantment Industry 1.2.5.SNAPSHOT-2

### **PLEASE READ ME BEFORE USE IT!**
This is a snapshot version, not a release version.

I don't have time to finish the full update right now, and subsequent fixes for issues will be done later. 
The basic functionality should be alright, but I still recommend that you back up your save.

### Change:
- Now we have our own Creative Mode Tab. Items are no longer in Creative Mode Tab of Create.
### Bugfix:
- Fix item might not show in JEI search
### Known Issues
- Blaze Enchanter renders incorrectly.
