## Create: Enchantment Industry 1.2.6.SNAPSHOT-2

Last Snapshot crashes due to I accidentally wrote a parameter in wrong place in CreateDragonLib(The Lib Mod has been Jar in Jar).
So here is the fix. Sorry for Inconvenience.

### **PLEASE READ ME BEFORE USE IT!**
This is a snapshot version, not a release version.

I don't have time to finish the full update right now, and subsequent fixes for issues will be done later.
The basic functionality should be alright, but I still recommend that you back up your save.

### Update
- Add configs for cost coefficient of Enchanting by Blaze Enchanter & Copying Enchanted Book
- Printer can copy Clipboard
- Bring back "merging items into Creative Tab of Create"
### Known Issues
- Blaze Enchanter renders incorrectly.
